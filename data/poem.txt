                When they die miles of walls divide them.
                Others build rock walls, one rock on another,
                And: then build a terrace, where they pray for love.

                Yet others build walls to enclose orchards,
                Endeavouring to find ways to fulfill hunger.
                A few others build rock walls – to make a home,
                It is their mission to serve humanity and nature.


                I have no house, only open spaces,
                Filled with truth, kindness and dreams.
                Desire to see my country developed and great,
                Dreams to see everywhere happiness and peace.
